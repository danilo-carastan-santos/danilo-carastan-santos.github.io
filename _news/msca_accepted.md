I am very proud to announce that my research project LIGHTAIGE has been accepted for the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-msca-2022-pf-01-01">Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowship 2022 </a>.

The goal of the LIGHTAIGE project is to approach the orchestration and simulation problems
of Edge Intelligence with cross­discipline, lightweight ang transparent methods to minimize the GHG emissions –
measured as the amount of equivalent CO2 emissions – of using Edge Intelligence.

I will be sharing information and news regarding LIGHTAIGE in the projects session of this webpage.
