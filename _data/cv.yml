        - 'This prestigious prize reward works in advanced computing
        (supercomputing, quantum computing, edge computing) and
        artificial intelligence. A jury of independent specialists and
        representatives of the French scientific and industrial world
        chooses and rewards several innovative projects. I, conjointly
        with Professor Denis Trystram, was awarded first place in the
        "Artificial Intelligence" category. My contribution to our
        contest submission, entitled <i> do better with less</i>, involves
        improving the operation of High-Performance Computing platforms,
        particularly by using Machine Learning to optimize the order of
        the applications to be executed.'
