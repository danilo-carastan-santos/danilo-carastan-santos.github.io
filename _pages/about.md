[comment]: <> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: <> Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

## Research Topics

My research takes place in the context of large-scale parallel and distributed infrastructures such as supercomputers and computing clusters and their applications, with a recent emphasis on limiting their energy consumption and environmental impacts.
Such infrastructures are complex in terms of high-level parallelism and heterogeneity, are shared by numerous users, and rapidly evolve over time. 
Such complexity raises many fundamental questions and technical challenges in order to exploit such infrastructures as efficiently as possible.

I organize my research activity in the following three research axes:

-   Data Science and Machine Learning applied to High-Performance
    Computing infrastructures' resource management

-   Frugal methods to limit the energy consumption and environmental
    impacts of distributed computing

-   Analysis and development of parallel and distributed infrastructures
    applications and architectures
